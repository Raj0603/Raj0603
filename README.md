# Hello Internet users!!!  o(*￣▽￣*)ブ

### Welcome to my ✨special✨ repository.

> Feel free to complain about my horrible writing skills & weird behaviour :)

## Small Bio (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞

Hi there!🖐 I'm a human being disguised as a software developer :man_technologist:. I spend my days typing on a ⌨, drinking ☕, and trying to understand why my code doesn't work 👁👄👁. When I'm not coding, you can find me 👀 anime, goofing around, or trying to teach my cat how to code.

I'm on a mission to write software that doesn't make people want to throw their computers out the window 👾. I have experience in a variety of programming languages and technologies, and I'm always learning new things.

If you're looking for someone who can write code and make you laugh at the same time, I'm your person (●'◡'●). Let's build something awesome together! 🤝
